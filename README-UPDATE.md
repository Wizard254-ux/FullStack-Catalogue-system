# User-Specific Data Update

This update adds user-specific data isolation to the Product Catalog Management System. Now, users can only see and manage their own products and categories.

## Changes Made

1. Updated database schema to include `user_id` in both products and categories tables
2. Modified backend APIs to filter data by the authenticated user
3. Added permission checks to prevent unauthorized access to products

## How to Apply the Update

1. Run the database schema update script:

```bash
cd Backend
npm run update-schema
```

2. Restart the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Testing

After applying the update:

1. Create a new user account
2. Log in with the new account
3. Verify that the new user doesn't see products created by other users
4. Create new products and categories with the new user
5. Verify that these are only visible to the user who created them

## Technical Details

- Products and categories are now linked to users via a `user_id` foreign key
- API endpoints filter data based on the authenticated user's ID
- Permission checks prevent users from accessing or modifying other users' data
